<h3>About</h3>
<p>The Future Talks were created to offer a platform to exchange knowledge about topics of today and the future. We usually meet on each first sunday of the month and share our personal experience in different topics like AI, Blockchain, AR/VR, Cloud computing or other current technology with others. Most times there is a short presentation about a topic, followed by a discussion and / or coding session, but there is generally no restriction to topics and form of the Future Talks.</p>
