Imagine a world, where artificial intelligence (AI) is used on a daily base, quantum computers perform calculations at incredible speeds and every human or device can be connected to exchange information.<br /> That world exists today. <br />Technology is ubiquitous but still many people remain unconscious about topics well worth exploring. Haven't you ever wondered how a machine can learn on its own? How everybody can agree on a thing that anybody can change ("Distributed Ledgers")? What can be achieved in different realities?<br /><br />
Nobody knows everything, but everybody knows something! Even you have knowledge about some interesting topics that others never got to explore that much or in that way. We think it's worth to share that knowledge with others and benefit from personal experiences with technology.<br />
