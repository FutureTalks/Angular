# Futuretalks

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.0.

## Setup

To install dependencies, run `npm install`. After folder node_modules is created and all packages have been installed, you can start a dev server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## For GitHub Pages publish run

To publish to GitHub Pages (https://futuretalks.github.io/Angular/), install angular-cli-ghpages globally: `npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages`

To build the page run `ng build --prod --base-href "https://futuretalks.github.io/Angular/"`

If you correctly installed angular-cli-ghpages you should now be able to publish the page using the command `ngh --message="Awesome Commitmessage"`. The files will be added to the 'gh-pages' branch of the project.
